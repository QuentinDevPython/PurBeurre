# Project purBeurre

This project involves retrieving products from the OpenFoodFacts site (https://fr.openfoodfacts.org) and storing them in a database.
The user of this project can then browse this database by choosing a category and then a product. 
An algorithm finaly proposes a substitute of this product with a better nutriscore (and with a maximum of category in common with the substituted product).
